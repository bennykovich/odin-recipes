        <h4>
            <em>Sisig (pronounced see-sig) is a Filipino pork dish 
                (specifically hailing from the Pampanga region of 
                the Philippines), typically seasoned with calamansi 
                or lime juice, and sauted with aromatics like onions, 
                garlic, and chilies. It’s tangy, savory, and slightly 
                spicy: the perfect pairing with an ice cold beer!</em>

    </p>    
    
    <p>
        <h4>
            <em>Traditional sisig was made from pig parts (mainly 
                its cheeks and ears), which dates back to the 
                American occupation in the Philippines. Pig heads 
                were sold for incredibly cheap back then, since the 
                U.S Air Force stationed in the area had no use for 
                them when preparing meals.</em>

    <p>
        <h4>
            <em>Nowadays, sisig has evolved tremendously to include 
                various protein variants; from chicken, tuna, squid, 
                and even tofu (my personal favorite). Even then, you’ll 
                still see the traditional version being sold almost 
                everywhere in the Philippines, even in Western Filipino 
                restaurants.</em>

        <strong>Notes</strong>
    </h3>
</p>

<p>
        <h4><em>Note 1:</em></h4>
        Sukang iloco is a type of vinegar made from fermented sugar 
        cane juice. This type of vinegar has a bold flavor that can 
        be compared to wine vinegars. You may use the following as 
        substitutes: cane vinegar, white vinegar, and distillled 
        vinegar.
</p>
    <p>
        <h4><em>Note 2:</em></h4>
        Fresh chicken livers are commonly used to make sisig. It 
        had to be boiled and mashed to have a paste-like consistency.
         The use of liver spread or liver pate is more for 
         convenience in case chicken livers are not available.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4><em>Note 3:</em></h4>
        Limes are great to use for sisig. However, calamansi 
        (calamondin) is a better fit if available.

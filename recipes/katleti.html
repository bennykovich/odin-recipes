        <h4>
            <em>Classic Russian kotleti, also commonly referred 
                to as “katleti”, are a lot like American meatballs. 
                The difference is they are fried patties that are 
                shaped and seasoned with a Slavic twist. Straight 
                from my family’s recipe book, this kotleti recipe 
                is made with a meat mixture of grated onions and 
                ground chicken and can be served anywhere you would 
                have a filling protein.</em>

            <ol>
            <p>    
                <li><em>Sauté finely chopped onions in a tablespoon 
                    of neutral cooking oil until soft and nearly 
                    translucent, then add finely chopped garlic and 
                    finely grated carrot and continue to sauté, 
                    adding a tad more oil if necessary, until carrots 
                    are soft then transfer to a mixing bowl to cool 
                    down a little.</em></li>
            </p>
                    <li><em>Soak three slices of white bread or slices of 
                    a small baguette in the milk so that the bread is 
                    completely submerged and absorbs the milk. When 
                    it’s very soft, squelchy and almost mushy, squeeze 
                    out the milk then transfer it to the mixing bowl.</em></li>
            <p>
                    <li><em>Add the chicken mince, sea salt, black pepper 
                    and finely chopped dill to the mixing bowl and 
                    combine well.</em></li>
            </p>
                    <li><em>Scoop up around 70g (2.4oz) of the chicken 
                    mince mixture with a tablespoon – it should be a 
                    big heaped tablespoon – then wet your hands and, 
                    using your hands, form the minced chicken mixture 
                    into an oval shaped meat patty that looks like a 
                    squashed meatball.</em></li>
            <p>
                    <li><em>Return the oval shaped chicken meat patty to 
                    the spoon and set it down on a tray then repeat 
                    the last step. The mixture you have should make 
                    around eight chicken patties, so you’ll need eight 
                    or so tablespoons at the ready and a tray that holds 
                    all eight or so spoons. Wash and dry your hands when 
                    you’re done.</em></li>
            <p>
                    <li><em>Heat 3cm cooking oil in a small, deep frying 
                    pan until it reaches 178°C (350°F), then gently 
                    drop your first chicken meatball into the hot oil, 
                    scooping some oil onto the top of the patty so it’s 
                    covered with oil. After a few minutes, using tongs, 
                    gently turn the patty over to check the colour. If 
                    it’s not quite done you can roll it over again in 
                    another couple of minutes. Remove the chicken patty 
                    when it’s a lovely golden-brown colour. And repeat 
                    until you’ve finished the mixture.</em></li>   
            </p>
                    <li><em>Plate immediately with mashed potatoes and a 
                    garden salad and dishes of sour cream and fresh 
                    dill on the side.</em></li>
